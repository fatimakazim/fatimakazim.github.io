# Reflections on Digital Literacy: A University Student’s Perspective

<p>As a 21-year-old student at a liberal arts college, my understanding of digital literacy has undergone a remarkable transformation over the course of my academic journey. What began as a simplistic view of technology as mere tools for productivity and entertainment has now evolved into a nuanced and multifaceted appreciation for the role of digital literacy in shaping my academic, creative, and personal experiences.</p>

## The Expanding Horizons of Digital Creativity and Collaboration

<p>My experience as an interactive media and arts major has deeply influenced my perspective on digital literacy. Studying how humans interact with these tools and finding ways to make those interactions smoother is the work I want to do as an aspiring user experience designer. I now recognize that digital platforms are not merely tools but integral components of my creative expression. Whether I'm designing user-friendly layouts in Figma for making websites, building AR-based projects, or editing videos using Premiere Pro, the digital realm has become a canvas for my ideas, a medium for my artistry, and a conduit for my collaborative efforts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have come to appreciate the ways in which digital tools facilitate communication and collaboration beyond the confines of the classroom. Since most of my courses are project-based, they involve a lot of group work. Platforms like Slack, Trello, and Discord have become indispensable in streamlining group assignments, organizing student events, and fostering connections with niche communities that share my interests in literature, design, and beyond. This understanding has broadened my perspective on the role of digital literacy, highlighting its significance not only in my academic pursuits but also in my personal and professional networks. With digital literacy, tasks can be approached more strategically and executed more efficiently.</p>

## Evolving Approaches to Digital Research and Information Management

<p>As I delve deeper into the realm of digital literacy, I have recognized the critical importance of developing proficient research skills and effectively managing information using the appropriate digital tools. Throughout this semester, I’ve used Sublime Text to document my assignments and upload them to GitHub. This process highlights how technology has transformed the way we approach academic work—allowing me to seamlessly integrate visualizations, interactive maps, embedded media, and research insights into a single, well-organized website. It’s made managing and presenting my assignments more efficient, engaging, and visually coherent. GitHub has become an invaluable resource for tracking code revisions, while in my game development class, Unity has enabled me to bring interactive experiences to life.</p>

<p>My peers in creative writing rely on Zotero to manage their sources, and art students access image databases like Artstor for visual analysis. These diverse approaches have underscored the interdisciplinary nature of digital literacy, as I have witnessed how students across various fields leverage digital tools to enhance their research, scholarship, and creative endeavors.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have explored the intersection of data analysis and the humanities by using tools like Voyant to uncover patterns and insights within large collections of literary texts. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of how different platforms serve different analytical purposes. For instance, working with both Voyant Tools and R allowed me to compare their strengths—Voyant is particularly effective for quick, web-based textual analysis and distant reading, helping identify trends without having to read each text in full, while R offers more advanced and customizable data manipulation for deeper, statistical analysis.</p>

<p>This comparison made it clear that digital literacy isn’t just about knowing how to use tools but understanding when and why to use them. It also opened my eyes to the possibilities of engaging with texts at scale, revealing patterns that traditional close reading might overlook. This experience has challenged my preconceptions about the role of data in the humanities, revealing how digital thinking can transcend disciplinary boundaries and foster a more holistic understanding of complex phenomena.</p>

<p>Now, at the end of the semester, I have also learned to master tools like Orange Data Mining and the Distant Viewing Toolkit, as well as multimodal platforms like 2D-CLIP. This showed me that digital literacy isn’t just about text or language—it’s about navigating across modalities, whether that’s text, image, or data. Orange allowed me to create workflows that made abstract patterns in data visible, while the Distant Viewing Toolkit helped me visualize recurring visual themes across large image corpora. 2D-CLIP, on the other hand, combined vision and language models, pushing me to think about how machines interpret art, aesthetics, and meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
As Geoffrey Rockwell and Stefan Sinclair point out in their article <i>False Positives</i>, the transition to big data methodologies—where vast volumes of information are analyzed computationally instead of being read or interpreted manually—has fundamentally transformed how knowledge is produced and interpreted, especially in the humanities.
</blockquote>

<p>This shift challenges traditional methods of close reading and emphasizes new ways of engaging with texts, such as pattern recognition, data visualization, and algorithmic analysis.</p>

<p>In this context, digital literacy becomes not just a useful skill but an essential one. As our world becomes increasingly data-driven, the ability to critically engage with digital tools and understand how data is collected, processed, and presented is vital. Whether in academia, business, healthcare, or public policy, data analysts and digitally literate individuals are in high demand because they can make sense of complex information and help others act on it responsibly. Thus, digital literacy empowers us to participate more fully in contemporary society—shaping not only how we research and communicate but also how we make informed decisions and solve real-world problems.</p>

## Embracing the Intersection of Humanities and Technology

<p>My foray into the field of digital humanities has been particularly transformative, as it has reshaped my understanding of textual analysis and the study of literature and history. Concepts like topic modeling and sentiment analysis have introduced me to computational methods that complement traditional close reading techniques, opening up new avenues for scholarly exploration and discovery.</p>

<blockquote>
In Albert Weber’s article, <i>Why We Should Digitize Historical Newspapers</i>, he emphasizes that “newspapers served for [minorities] as information and discussion platforms where basic questions were debated and reached out to the not rarely geographically dispersed members of the minority.”
</blockquote>

<p>This quote helped me recognize that newspapers are more than sources of daily news—they are vessels of identity, communication, and history, especially for underrepresented communities. Learning about this gave me a deeper appreciation for digital tools as a means of cultural preservation and equity.</p>

<blockquote>
In his article <i>LLMs and Practical Knowledge: What is Intelligence?</i>, Barry Smith argues that LLMs, despite impressive advancements, fundamentally lack the capacity for what he calls "practical or tacit knowledge." He writes, “The tasks we have listed involve practical or tacit knowledge… captured not by means of sentences… but rather through the expertise demonstrated in human actions.”
</blockquote>

<p>This shows that LLMs may be able to mimic language, but they cannot replicate the physical, intuitive, and socially embedded expertise that human beings develop through lived experience. In short, knowing that is not the same as knowing how, and LLMs can only do the former.</p>

## Navigating the Ethical Landscape of Digital Literacy

<p>As my digital literacy skills have developed, I’ve become increasingly aware of the social and ethical dimensions of the technologies I use. In <i>Role and Challenges of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Similar Generative AI in Arts and Humanities</i> by Rane and Choudhary, the authors highlight a crucial concern: AI systems are trained on datasets that often contain inherent biases. These biases can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce existing inequalities through the content they generate.</p>

<p>This is especially significant in fields like the arts and humanities, where conversations around representation, diversity, and inclusion are central. Digital literacy, therefore, is not just about mastering tools—it’s also about cultivating a critical mindset. It involves understanding the limitations of technology, questioning the sources and intentions behind the data, and resisting the urge to blindly trust AI-generated outputs.</p>

## Looking Ahead: Embracing Lifelong Digital Learning

<p>Moving forward, I see digital literacy as a dynamic and evolving process, rather than a static set of skills. The rapid pace of technological change, the emergence of transformative tools like artificial intelligence, and the ever-evolving landscape of digital platforms and applications have instilled in me a deep sense of curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning.</p>

<p>This semester, for the first time, I had to directly use AI for my assignments, which gave me a lot of insights. I noticed that while AI can be helpful for brainstorming and creative tasks, it also has its limitations, especially when it comes to extracting data from images or providing accurate citations. It tends to hallucinate or sound confident even when it’s wrong, which taught me to be more critical and cautious while using it. I’ve started thinking of AI more as a collaborator than a solution.</p>

<p>As I continue my academic journey, I aim to cultivate not only technical proficiency but also a critical and creative mindset toward the digital world around me. This involves questioning assumptions, exploring ethical considerations, and embracing the interdisciplinary nature of digital literacy. The liberal arts environment, with its emphasis on critical thinking, collaborative problem-solving, and the integration of diverse perspectives, has been instrumental in shaping this approach.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my understanding of digital literacy has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from a narrow focus on tools and technologies to a more holistic appreciation for the intersections of digital and human experiences. By embracing this evolving perspective, I am confident that I can navigate the digital landscape with greater intentionality, creativity, and ethical awareness, ultimately becoming a more well-rounded and digitally literate individual.</p>
